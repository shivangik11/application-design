## Application Design: Travel Planner

As a result of everyone's hectic schedule, it is difficult for them to organize their travel, and most individuals aren't very good at planning things. It is a hassle to plan your trip, and if you don't, you might end up missing out on stuff. Because of this, I've been mulling over the possibility of developing a travel planner application that will assist you in easily and quickly planning your trip without requiring you to invest an excessive amount of time. 

With this application, I want to build something that is easy to use and explore by all kind of people. In addition, I wanted to concentrate on the accessibility features that are included in this application. 

This application is going to help you schedule your day when you are traveling, and it will also assist you in inserting and loading all of your bookings and planning an itinerary for your vacations and staycations, as well as providing you with a packing list. I still need to put the finishing touches on the flow and information architecture of the app, but in general, it is going to cover:

### Process to be followed

Since I am new to coding and I want to develop a good understanding of it, I have started looking for platforms where I can learn swift ui in a more advanced way. I would like to get some hands-on practice with it. Since I am new to coding, I have been spending the majority of my time learning the fundamentals of it and pondering how I can make it easier for myself. Multiple tutorials that were sent to me for the class that I am currently enrolled in, and I am currently working through them thoroughly along with the reading assignments. 

With the help of this project, I have begun creating and seeking for similar items that are already on the market, both of which will assist me in navigating this entire journey and will enable me to get the feel of using this platform. After that, I would like to jump on the section of coding where I have a good understanding of SwiftUI as well as a better understanding with the outcome as well. Initially, I intend to create a mockup of this application in a prototyping software and understand the user flow as well as the information architecture of it.

### XD Prototype
